LA Courthouse Ride
This simple application was designed to visualize Tony Stelzer's personal journey across Louisiana parishes on his 1996 BMW R1100RT ("Red"). As parishes are visited, photos of the bike in front of the courthouse of the Parish Seat and the visit date will be documented. Parishes are grouped into feasible trip groups, though not necessarily respected and visited in that order. 

The application is simple and fully self-sufficient. HTML, CSS, JS, and photos are all combined into a GitHub Repo. While updates can be saved locally, they must be made in source control to propagate to all users/devices.
